Even if he does he won''t be interested in posting a comment here. Well I understand the feelings everyone is haveing over here maybe I''m just in SE and I got a lot more to see. About "actual Position" I just want to say when I was in 3rd sem I got very less term work marks so I worked upon it and did well in my 4th sem. The term work marks are directly proportional to what you score in classtest. Teachers give you the question bank. Most ask the same questions that have been repeated in just last year''s papers. I scored well in this times termwork so I felt that college is doing justice to my hardwork. Maybe you guys are right. What happens in other colleges is different. I have friends in Thakur they are not bothered about class test nor about the attendance and are enjoying their college life and still being able to score amazing marks (infact more than me) because that much tough evaluation no one does. That gives a bad feeling as to why a less deserving student in a lower cut-off college getting more internal marks than me. That''s why I also said don''t take this college and go somewhere else. You got this college on your merit but your merit won''t give you a good college life if you choose to come here. I worked hard I got my termwork corrected. There are students who work hard, very hard but their hard work is not paid and they don''t score well in classtests. So their termwork reduces... in fact suffers but well that does not mean that the student has no potential. and should get termwork like 13 and 14 that''s like very bad. Also about the profs I tell you every subject has two or three profs.. You may get the one who teaches the worse. and has no knowledge abt the subject. Go approach others you will be shocked to see the response.. We often hesitate to meet other profs who don''t teach us. Maybe there are more tough and horrible faculties I still have to face. But till the SE level I feel the college is going normal. I won''t say great.. I''m just justifying what all I have said. As I''m saying there is a lot more to see. You all have passed out so you are giving the comments you feel from your heart I''m still studying and hope few things from college. If you loose hope on the college you will have a very VERY tough time. Imagine me. I''m among you people.
