'In 2010 major recruiters were: TCS, Reliance,ZyanGenerally L & T, Wipro, Infosys, Godrej & Boyce, Tata Motors, etc. are few of the companies that visit this campus to meet their requirement of engineers. But don\'t go by the name of the companies, because the number of students placed is just around 50\%. In the recession year 2009, they fell down to 20\%. Average salary offered is around Rs. 2.4 lac p.a. ',neg
'As for placements, 10 students were selected out of 60 in campus. So you will either have to stand out of other students or will have to look for off-campus placements. ',neg

'Paid HEAVY capitation fees and left college. the strictness in the air, the rules and regulations......boy oh boy...it\'s a school... take my word keep it as your last option... VERY STRICT ',neg
'I\'m studying in this college. It provides awesome facilities but the teaching staff is the worst staff in the world. They are over pressuring students and give very poor internal marks. It affects on our \% score and teachers are not friendly. Shame on them, but they can\'t hide it from the ALMIGHTY. He will punish them for it. ',neg
'College is too strict about attendance and if students fail to maintain 75\%, parents are called up. ',neg
'HORRENDOUS crowd : YOU CANT LIVE WITH THEM.Students talk in marathi too. ',neg
'the festivals part is a joke. No one really cares except those who come from muncipality marathi medium school who have never had an annual day in their life.I still have 3 years left in college. I hope I survive. ',neg
'Teachers talk in marathi. Teachers dont know shit about what they teach. ',neg
'The wifi connectivity does not work ',neg
'The college is not in malad. Its in effin kandivali. Its not 15 mins away from station. It takes forever to reach there. ',neg
'Canteen facilities have worsened ',neg
'I recently joined this college in the Mechanical Stream. Since 80\% of the crowd are Maharashtrians professors teand to switch to the local language during lectures. This inconveniences students like me who aren\'t too comfortable with Marathi. ',neg
'college fest is not that good ',neg
'Companies like TCS, Siemens and L&T Infotech usually come to recruit students, and the placements as a whole are pretty average. Chemical & IT had better placements than other branches. Hardly 35\% to 40\% students managed to get placed during 2013. Before that about 70-75\% of students got placed, with the average package being roughly Rs 2.8 Lakh per annum. ',neg
'no campus recruitment at all(don\'t look at notice board-its all misleading thats just to take your admission) ',neg
'Professors lack skills and vocabulary. ',neg
'I am a FE computer engineering student. I tell you guys do not believe the comments above. it is a third class college. illiterate teachers, worst crowd, telling from bottom of my heart ',neg
'hostel rooms feel congested (but one can manage with it) but due to the just one common bathroom on each floor, its a huge turn-off.',neg
'They have become really strict about attendance at Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, especially in the first year. There may be problems at the time of submissions and even parents may be called. There are even chances of getting detained if it\'s too low. ',neg
'attadance is very strict so you cant enjoy college life here.. ',neg
'They have great knowledge about the subjects. But there are only a bunch of Professors who can actually deliver the lecture in an interesting way. ',neg
'It’s sad !! The attendance is very strict. The minimum criterion of 75\% needs to be fulfilled in general, but out here you need NINETY PERCENT !!(90\%). Holy crap!! ',neg
'Really far for people coming from South Mumbai or the Western Suburbs. Nearest Rly. Stn is C.B.D. Belapur—about 10 minutes from the college on foot. ',neg
'This is a major drawback. The students do participate in the intercollegiate festivals as well the IPA festivals, but the college itself has no festival. Its just every alternate year that a fest kind of thing is held. It also has the alumni meet. ',neg
'Quite a few students get recruitment offers directly after the Final (Fourth) Year B. Pharm., but it is advisable to complete a Masters or an MBA or some other degree. B. Pharm by itself cannot fetch you a good job. ',neg
'Students are not at all satisfied with the professors who they claim are dispirited because of their low salaries. There are just two or three permanent faculties and the rest keep changing. ',neg
'We don\'t know why the college is called what it is, but the city of Mumbai is not even remotely as dead as this college is. You should avoid it at all costs. ',neg
'Worst college, even for students as well as for working faculty... no support, lacks proper working coandition & even library not upthated... even students plays politics with staff & teachers... absolutely no use... waste of money especially for professional courses as on specialization is provided nor lectures are taken on time ',neg
'No part of the arts, science and commerce section is air-conditioned. The minuscule library is only as big as two classrooms put together, but fortunately enough books available for the students. The computer lab is nothing great; a considerable number of computers don\'t work. ',neg
'Mumbai College of Arts, Commerce and Science is pretty lenient about attendance. There are CCTVs installed in every class but the only purpose they serve is showing off. The college absolutely doesn\'t care about attendance. ',neg
'It reminds you of an inter state bus terminal of some godforsaken village in India. It\'s small, cramped, crowded and pretty expensive taking it\'s condition into consideration. ',neg
'The crowd is mainly composed of academically underachieving students who can easily be described as bland - absolute lack of enthusiasm. Ratio of girls to boys is a pathetic 4:1 ',neg
'Quite awful, to be honest. Only the top six or seven students in B.Sc. (IT) get placed, that too with packages of only 1.2 lac per annum. Other branches get no placements. It\'s quite bleak here. ',neg
'To quote a student, ‘You cannot hang out in Airoli!’. Students have to travel all the way to Nerul, Vashi and Kharghar for a typical mall hangout. ',neg
'The crowd is good & the campus is a bit small almost negligible and the small thing which I don\'t like abt it is the time management..we have to fill up all kinda forms during lectures. There is no separate time given for that and probably we have to miss a lec to do these things. ',neg
'crowd is concerned, let me tell you that your residential proof isn\'t your decency certificate. Anybody can create nuisance. That is why we have a slightly \'tighter\' security. and those complaining about infrastructure weren\'t blindfolded before taking admission here and spending thousands (and also lakhs by a handful). ',neg
'This college is only for Gujaratis and not for others......so non-Gujaratis please think twice before you Apply...to this college.... ',neg
'professors tell students to come for their private tuitions at evening and dont even care of lectures in the college...thats what most students say about this college.. ',neg
'If you want to get to the college, ask the rickshaw wala to drop you at Cooper Hospital, they don\'t know this college by name. ',neg
'The canteen’s look is not that great but the food is quite good & cheap. For those whose taste buds are accustomed to Chinese cuisine, this place is heaven. However, lack of seating facility doesn’t make the experience a good one, especially if you enter the canteen around the peak time. There’s little space to move and the temperature has nearly doubled! ',neg
'The so called \"New and Better\" canteen is very bad, Food items are overpriced and usually uandercooked. ',neg
'full of sad and non fun loving people....they consider bunking as a mortal sin and teachers as live GODS....if you are a fun loving person this place will turn you into the saddest place on earth.....and people fron the western suburbs...stay away from this \"military school\" ',neg
'All the good reviews received are probably fake... I hope the admins of this website take note and hence forward do not allow anonymous reviews... I believe that the college authorities are giving all the good reviews and positive votes for the reviews and same goes for the negative votes for a bad review... they college doesn\'t give a damn about your future if you score below 70\%... if you were ill and are in the defaulters list they will just say that health is important and ask you to take the semester off and waste an year of your life...if you have 2 kts they humiliate you and your parents and say that you are not fit for engineering...they take REVIEWS about the professors from students just for the sake of making a list of students to harass... in the sem of may 2013 in mechanical engineering one professor was appointed who had just passed his b.e. and when each and every student gave a bad review no one did anything but the HOD gave him the permission to coanduct vivas for the semester and he gave 20 people kt for revenge and then as he had no guts ran off to the US... I hope this is a proof that they don\'t care about your future...and lastly placements it is good for comps but in mech it is 10\% and extc just the IT companies give jobs and not their stream... ',neg
'As far as the Mechanical Department is concerned, the college sucks big time. Only a few handful teachers actually know their subject. ',neg
'Mediocre. No support whatsoever from the management as far as sports are concerned. A little here and there sometimes to show they are concerned. It does have a very well maintained ground, but that\'s that. ',neg
'Quite strict on this front. 60\% attendance is recommended. Parents are called to meet the teachers and extra assignments are given to the defaulters. ',neg
'Why is this college in Kurla when it is near Vidyavihar station? Not at all suitable for students in Navi Mumbai. Waste of too much time. ',neg
'Never go for this college!Too much pressurisation (which does not happen in any other colleges) ',neg
'Students claim that the college authorities try to scare them off with warnings and empty threats in the first year. Although a few students fall for it, the bolder lot don\'t really care and finally manage to escape. In the later years, the students themselves attend whatever they love to (in architecture, that covers atleast three-fourths of the lectures). Again just like a typical architecture college, submissions need to be on time - relaxations are given but marks honoured are equally lesser. ',neg
'There\'s no canteen dedicated to the architecture college in particular but there are two canteens shared by all the colleges in the campus - the newly renovated law college canteen and the old and popular medical canteen. Apart from that students here munch on the delicacies which their hotel management colleagues have cooked. ',neg
'Canteen is worst you will only get tea, coffee, vada pav, samosa and spring roll (occasionally). That\'s it. ',neg
'Euphoria is the cultural festival of Fr. Agnel College of Engineering held in even semesters and \"Crescendo\" is the technical fest held in odd semesters. The college is not very supportive for the fests which disappoints students and they lose interest in conducting them. Hence little participation is seen in the fests. ',neg
'yes/// last year google did come but did not pick even one student from college its a just a name given in the placement of college/// ',neg
'PhD holders in this college actually teach worst where as the freshers teach better ',neg
'I thought I would learngreat stuff here create softwares but I sit all day long by hearing text books and at the eand of the sem the teacher says you didn\'t tellme the definition from this text book. Yes tech max is a bible you people seriously expect us to read 1000-1500 pgbooks in 3 months with weekly exams and assignments and projects and monthly exams then get a life. Forcing attendance over us to sit for your lectures is like saying that I will kick your ass you if you don\'t attend and even if you do I will kick your butt later on. We can learn on our own we don\'t need your help, if we need it we will ask. and not that we hate projects but come one if you keep projects involving only theory then damn sure we are fed up.and if we want to do something different the great HOD says you won\'t get attendance and if you fall low on it you have to write 70+ pages of assignments as a punishment and I am like are you crazy. WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE TO JOIN FR.CRCE it\'s a thug college nothing more to say. Never recommeanding it to anyone ever.MORAL : DON\'T DO THE MISTAKE OF JOINING CRCE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPOIL YOUR LIFE. ',neg
'Computers in this college are very slow with wiandows 98 OS and with huge dabba type monitors ',neg
'Attendance at Fr CRCE is quite strict. It has to be maintained above 75\% no matter what. No grace attendance given even for students participating extra-curricular. Every week attendance is checked. If the weekly attendance is less than 75\% then the student won’t be allowed to attend the lab sessions. Long procedure to be followed if name appears in defaulters. Parents are called and lengthy assignments are given as punishment. It is not a place to be in if you want to bunk too much! A lot of students even call it a JAIL. ',neg
'It is quite congested, food is edible but not to suit the taste buds. It is often unhygienic and extremely oily. Students have tried to change it by writing many letters but all in vain. Most students prefer dabba they bring from their home over canteen. ',neg
'IT/Comps Faculty are very bad and they\'re charging such high fees for this. ',neg
'A pretty new management college on Koparkhairane. Hmmm. What do you expect? The lowest CET scorers end up here, and theres nothing too impressive about them. The crowd isn\'t bad or anything, it\'s just slightly... Lifeless. ',neg
'GIMSR hosts intra-college sports days and annual days, but that\'s about it. Some bands perform once in a while during some of these Days, but it\'s not much. ',neg
'As for placements, well, the less said the better. Yes, it\'s a new college, but the placement record is quite awful, really. About twenty percent of students manage getting job offers, and even then the average packages are nothing above 2.5 lac per year. Companies like Amul, Hindustan Times have (allegedly) picked up students from here. ',neg
'It\'s closed!! Perhaps because most students bring their own tiffins to college and there are few takers of the canteen food, thus it\'s not favourable for any of the contractors. ',neg
'Absolutely no support from the college. Students have to hunt for jobs on their own or opt for higher studies. ',neg
'However one can develop stress if his/her attendance is below the mark as the college is strict in this aspect. The university norm is 75\% but college expects its students to go beyond that and maintain at least 80\%. If it falls short of that your internal marks may be deducted. ',neg
'Unbearable teaching...do NOT be dependent on them at all! Majority of them are visiting staff. Only a handful of them are dedicated. Also, with the new principal, the college has become stricter and more discipline is expected from students. ',neg
'Bad! Bad! Bad! There are 2 canteens, one on the 4th floor and another on the ground floor, which is the sarvajanik canteen (common for architecture, management, event management, school kids and outsiders). The 4th floor canteen is just like the pantry car of the Indian railways. Chips, cold drinks, samosas, vada pav and cutlets are available there. The sarvajanik canteen which should be merely 30sq.m., provides all variety of food. But the food is not that great. ',neg
'The placements are mismanaged. Companies coanducted interviews but hardly took anyone even though students know they did well in interviews. ',neg
'college isnt that good...especially the teaching staff is rude and monotonous..placement officer is an highly uninterested person...nw may will dislike this comment but its the truth... ',neg
'I\'m in Comps. I learn more from YouTube tutorials than I learn in lectures. ',neg
'A very poor faculty...its hard to connect with them...no practical knowledge...just about marks...please stay away from it :-( ',neg
'the lowpoints about this college are its infrastructure and its place of location. ',neg
'there is no regular water supeopley in washrooms! ',neg
'train frequency on central line is very very poor !!trains are always 10-15 late than the scheduled time ',neg
'They have festivals every year sometime in December. Though the fests don’t really have a name as such, they are quite popular and well-participated-in. ',neg
'although faculty rocks but for serious archi studemts... this ain\'t the place... ',neg
'Although the building of Kamala Raheja College of Architecture is nothing special, students are full of praise for the infrastructure. There are no ‘classrooms’ as such, just massive halls where everyone can see everyone and that\'s exactly the kind of space, future architects would need, isn\'t it ?The library is top-grade; students say that it’s one of the best architecture libraries in the city. No part of the college is air-conditioned, but it’s quite well-ventilated (Architectural studies put to work...) ',neg
'As is the case in almost any architecture school, attendance is pretty strict. Students are expected to maintain a minimum of 75\% attendance, failing which strict action is taken. Very often students get year drops if attendance falls below 60\%. ',neg
'Not something to be very proud of, in short. There is a ‘canteen area’, but there are no tables, few chairs, and not much more. The food isn’t great, and the pricing isn’t reasonable. In spite of that, Raheja-ites love their canteen and spend hours and hours on the floor chit-chatting. ',neg
'Sadly, there are no festivals in Welingkar MBA college but round the year there are some or the other events that take place which keeps the students quite occupied with their extracurricular activities. ',neg
'they are not upto the average mark but still ask a heavy donation.. its lame ',neg
'THE PROFFESOR is not completely matured.they always keep on calling parents for silly resoan. we feel that we are in school not in Engineering college. ',neg
'The road to the white tall building LR Tiwari Engineering College is under construction. Moreover, it’s pretty bad and dusty. The infrastructure is decent enough. As the college is newly constructed, it has modern infrastructure with all amenities. The labs are well equipped and classrooms are well ventilated. Classrooms are spacious and benches are comfortable. All the laboratories are air conditioned. Library has plenty of books. Washrooms, most of the time, are clean. The college is enabled with a wifi connection though often there are restrictions to use it. ',neg
'Students say that 75\% is compulsory and LR Tiwari follows it religiously. Falling short of attendance will cost you loads of assignment work and sometimes fine (yeah, monetary fine). For terribly low attendance, parents are called. It’s advised to attend lectures regularly unless you share an excellent rapport with the respective teacher. However, there has never been a case of detainment or year back due to attendance. Moderately strict college as far as attendance is considered. ',neg
'The terribly bad location is a big turn off when it comes to hangouts. Restaurants like CCD, Pizza Hut and Chilliza have opened up recently and there is also your hot favourite McDonald’s which is at a mere 15 minutes walking distance. The roadside foodstalls, farsan shops and a few restaurants just outside Mira Road station are generally the hotspot destination for LR Tiwari-ites. ',neg
'Old faculty is fine but young faculty is less experienced; they are just passed out students. They are of full of attitude and they always discourage the students.Teaching is also not that good. It is ok ok. ',neg
'College is very understanding about attendance has decreased the threshold to 60\%. But if you fail to keep even this much then you’ll be in for serious trouble and course of action taken against you may range from doing extra assignments to a year drop. So better be careful about it. ',neg
'Canteen is very bad you won\'t get any variety of food. As compared to food the cost is very high. college students prefer to eat outside. ',neg
'Attendance is a very big issue here since the principal has changed. No matter what each and every day needs to be attended with your respective submissions. COME WHAT MAY!!! ',neg
'The canteen seems to have a good crowd round the clock during college hours. Food is quite cheap and tasteless too!!!!People are mostly seen completing their submissions rather than having food…this speaks itself how the canteen is… ',neg
'1,00,000+ fees, No Gymkhana, No ground, Non-hygenic canteen, None of the lift works except exam time, college takes money for gymkhana + college i-cards and so on, doesn\'t issues cards and there isn\'t any gymkhana at all... None of the equipments of the labs work... EXTC is worst... This college is only money making collegege... ',neg
'No waters in washroom ...leakage and dirty washrooms... Practicle building is ok... no campus at all now ....basket ball quort withot basket..... dirty washrooms... no one to clean washrooms.... Faculty are ok ...Please visit both the buildings ,washroom, and canteen before admission or else.. you will cry ',neg
'They are real strict about the attendance here..!! ',neg
'Very unhyginic place..canteen on basement which is dirty. ',neg
'and let\'s face it, the canteen is pretty awful. The Biriyani is particularly good and is a favorite amongst my friends and I. ',neg
'Only biomed branch is in a slightly better position..they had decent placements...that too just one company! Other branches like IT & COMPS had companies (and by companies I mean just 2 of it) coming..but no one got placed...and rest all other branches...well they didn\'t even have a company coming!! ',neg
'Teachers...yes they are all themselves studyin..are frshers...& don\'t even bother to take lectures ',neg
'This college fees are a lot more according to the facilities, faculty, infrastructure, etc. which students want but dont get in this college. Rather, my advice is take admission in Terna, RAIT, BVP which have lesser fees and yet fulfill student\'s requirements at least. ',neg
'The 1st words that come to my miand are pathetic and wasteInfrastructure-its uander construction will always remain same way do not expect anything places stinks there won\'t be any improvement whatsoever ',neg
'Students with exponentially decreasing attendance figures such as 30\% to 3\% to 0.3\% have been found to get away easily. So no problems on this front. “Just produce a fake medical certificate and it’ll do the work for you”, says one of their student. ',neg
'The bus service sucks..u dont get a railway concession on time. ',neg
'Well MGM has worst canteen i have ever experienced.. ',neg
'Mumbai Educational Trust for Pharmacy is quite strict in terms of attendance. Students have to maintain 75\% compulsorily. If they fall short of the attendance, the portion is doubled for periodic tests. For extremely low attendance, parents get a phone call and are often seen in the Principal’s office. ',neg
'Usually you hear, ‘Mam/Sir, may I come in’. Well, in Majithia College the scene is reversed. Most of the times, the class is jam packed but the professor is either absent or late. Moreover, the teaching is also okay! Even though most of the communication takes place in English, this ‘late coming’ habit of the professors is a regular complain. ',neg
'There are no recruiters for BCOM students but BIF students are the lucky ones as HDFC Life saves their life. ',neg
'As rightly said by a group of Majithia students, ‘If you don’t get admission anywhere, then ONLY come here. Hum toh yahan phass gaye!’ ',neg
'the institute is run by narrow mianded gujju trust ',neg
'Niranajana Majithia College of Commerce is a 3 storey building with an extremely small campus. The library of this college is just about Okay with books not available sometimes. The classrooms are decent and BMM and BIF students get the liberty to use air conditioners. There is no facility for internet in the college. ',neg
'The attendance in Majithia College is not at all strict. Even though the authorities mention ‘75\% compulsory’, most of them fall in the late 40’s, sometimes late 30’s also. Yes, the attendance for TYBCom is pretty strict but rest of the students are habituated to freedom. ',neg
'In one word, BAD! The canteen is less spacious and does not serve tasty food. Though the prices of the items in the canteen are affordable, students demand good and delicious food. A big ‘thumbs down’ to the canteen of this college. ',neg
'You ask any Majithia student related to hangouts and the first word you hear is ‘Raghuleela Mall’ in Poisar. It’s a hot favourite hangout for students of this college. Students prefer to go for movies in Grovels (Kandivali East) and Cinemax outside Kandivali station. The college lacks local hangouts. ',neg
'The Management of the college is useless, no one is ready to take responsibilities. I would say they are running this college just to make money. ',neg
'The professors aren\'t out-of-the-box fantastic but they aren\'t intolerable either. Mediocre faculty, one can say, which the students can\'t really complain about. ',neg
'It\'s almost as if it\'s absent - a small shed somewhere around the backyard of the college. Food is not preferred by the students here, neither is its ambience. It\'s best to avoid it. ',neg
'The less said the better. The lecturers are missing half the time and complete their portions in haste later on. Students without personal coaching often find themselves in trouble. ',neg
'college campus is dirty. Obviously a MAWALI crowd is present troubling many of the girls in the college. ',neg
'Cultural fest or any other event in this college is done on just name sake basis. You cannot enjoy in this college. ',neg
'Eligible students are offered placements at some of the best companies like Essar, Polaris, HCL, LG, Sahara. The salaries offered are from 1.8 lakh to 3.3 lakh per annum with an average of 2.46 lakh p.a.. Unfortunately, though, not too many students are eligible. ',neg
'Some professors are very rude and strict and threaten students to fail. ',neg
'The construction of college is accused to be illegal. They are fighting in court. ',neg
'Attendance used to be really lenient for the previous years. Owing to the change in the management and principal roping in, the attendance has become pretty strict. Students are asked to attend 75\% of the lectures failing which term marks will be reduced, loads of assignments will be burdened on your shoulders, and for worst cases, parents will be called. ',neg
'Real bad! You would torture your taste buds. I\'d rather prefer skipping my meal than to even dare step into the canteen of Vasantdada Patil College of Engineering! The Chinese food is edible if at all you have to have your meals in there. ',neg
'The faculty of Patkar College is quite average. While most of the professors are MSc’s, a few of the professors don’t have complete knowledge regarding the subject. Lecturers usually communicate in English but most of them use regional languages. Also, the science faculty is pretty strict when it comes to submissions. Commerce faculty, too, is not something great to look for. ',neg
'Faltu college....Please avoid this collegeYour life will be hell... ',neg
'Patkar College is quite strict when it comes to attendance. Though 75\% is compulsory, sometimes 60-65\% is also tolerated. Below this mark, either parents are called or the student are harassed during submissions. ',neg
'BSC and BMS students get placed. Unfortunately, there aren’t any companies recruiting the BMM kids. ',neg
'A major issue here is the hangouts, or rather the lack of them. Most people end up driving to Karnala or Lonavala, both of which are half an hour away. Chilling at Kharghar is an option too, but there’s not a hell of a lot to do there either. ',neg
'NO HANG OUT PLACES AT ALL IN 15KM RADIUS, so if you are thinking of bunking then plan a complete day out instead of coming to college & then bunk for entire day. ',neg
'Sports events,Fest and everything is organized with students\' money.The college doesn\'t provide funds for it.Nobody attends the fests anyway..haha. ',neg

'About hangouts... Really? In Ghansoli? You have to go to Vashi to find something to do, and anyway the students here aren\'t the \'hanging out\' type. ',neg
'Placements....hmmm. Very few companies show up. Very, very few students get placed. Packages are very, very, very low. ',neg
'If you\'re actually considering this college, you probably don\'t have much of a choice. Best of luck. ',neg
'Faculty at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Technology (RGIT) in general is average. Some professors have no clue of the subject at all. There are a handful of professors who have requisite knowledge to be there teaching you. Students have accepted the chalta hai attitutde and thus the staff over the years has been the same and less bothered. ',neg
'computers professors are worst,they know handful of things, with which they will play merri-go-rouand. Mostly are M.E students. ',neg

'Very strict. You have to have 75\% attendance. ',neg
'Worst college in the whole world If you are thinking to get admission in it please change your miand. ',neg
'Now, we found this a little disappointing but certainly not the worse in Mumbai. The classrooms have 2 air conditioners each. The labs are less equipped with apparatus; some are faulty and some aren’t even there. There’s no college ground but there are lots of public grounds nearby for sports enthusiasts especially cricket which beats in every Rizvites heart. The toilets often stink; so it is advised that you finish off your stuff at home. The infrastructure is improving though. ',neg
'As said before you can perform well by taking advantage of low attendance criteria (avg 30-40\%) & placements are less, as low number of students are eligible. ',neg
'Attendance is strict and professors are said to taunt irregular students. Everyone has to have over 80\% attendance or the compensation is extra assignments. ',neg

Other than Engineering drawing, in my 4 years study, I couldnt find a single person whome I can call sir from bottom of my heart. Absolutely waste quality. One professor used to teach Microprocessor and used to give marks based on number of pages answer written. No jokes folks that was the case. One person used to force to attend his private coaching. Hope he is not there now. I feel ashamed of saying my college name in my organisation.

Average salaries are around 2.5 to 3 lakh per year, the highest being 4 lakh per year.Jobs are difficult to find for the MCA students though.

Since the college is adjacent to one of the Government administrative buildings, due to some reason, the authorities are not allowed to install Wi-Fi on the campus. However, the college has left no room for complaint even in such a scenario; it has made available internet points through LAN at numerous locations which can be used freely by the students. One big advantage here being that the college provides for FREE laptops and thus the students don\'t mind buying their own wireless dongles\' leaving no room for lack of internet connectivity. Hostel facility is also available and those who\'ve opted for the hostel seemed quite happy with it. A lack of a canteen is the only thing that students could think about on the downside. But even that will be taken care of soon, say the authorities. ',pos
'Attendance is relaxed upto certain limits and as long as students are performing well academically. ',pos
'AIMS can be seen as soon as you step out of CST\'s rear exit. It lies close to the Times of India Building on DN Road and right next to the famous JJ School of Architecture.

'No hangouts as such, but one can go to Khargar or Vashi and visit malls and chill. Although these places are a bit far. ',pos
'It’s mixed. Students come from all places. From town, Navi Mumbai and also from other places that are out of the town. ',pos
'There\'s a ground behind the college which the students call the \"yard\", and is definitely the most popular and perhaps the only hangout near the college. Other than that students have to go to Matunga or Dadar in hunt for better places. ',pos
'The faculty is pretty cool and friendly. The termwork out of 25 in the computer dept is pretty much based on your attendance(5m for 75\% and above) 10 m - Journal (Based on your rapport with the professor) and the rest 10 on your prelim performance. If you do well you can easily score 23 off 25. ',pos
'the canteen is changed now..a much better and larger one..so i guess its time to change the details ;) ',pos
'the crowd is getting better and a lot of other changes. ',pos
'The festivals mentioned were quite decent this year,especially the tech fest was very good. ',pos
'the Fests do lack the frills, but are decent enough ',pos
'There are some reputed companies which recruit students from our college. Overall it is a nice college. Get in and experience it. ',pos
' Placements 100\%? Nowadays, even IITs don\'t have 100\% placements. ',pos
'Very nice college. Location is also good. Canteen needs some improvement ASAP. Teaching staffs are cooperative and overall very good college. ',pos
'the teachers are extremely co-operative ',pos
'the new building has been constructed and it is probably one of the best infra in Mumbai engineering colleges. ',pos
'the new building is excellent its campus is bigger in terms of floors rather than acres... it is the tallest engineering college in Mumbai ',pos
'Maintain attendance...!!! Complete your journals time to time...!! Regular study....!!! If you maintain all above... then and only then you are in the best college. ',pos
'They say you’ll be safe if you maintain around a 60\%, which isn’t too bad. Even if you find yourself well below that mark, no ‘strict action’ as such is reportedly taken at Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE). Probably a couple of assignments or test papers to be written. Fair enough. ',pos
'Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) is located quite conveniently close to Airoli railway station on the trans-harbour route. The campus is just about 5-6 minutes away from the railway station and its not a very bad walk either. ',pos
'This college is the next best college for CIVIL after the autonomous institutes ',pos
'The canteen has changed completely..much wider and better..nothing to complain. ',pos
' Its one of the best at DJ Sanghvi, at least in the first year; you will realize it if you attend. The other years have good professors for one or two out of six or seven subjects while the others are average. You might meet a couple of nagging professors but the rapport with the students is pretty good. Students find the teachers friendly and helpful. ',pos
'Papillon Restaurant (You will find most of the college here), Amar, NM Canteen, the very famous street side vada pavs, dosas and everything you want, Cooper canteen (if you have the guts!). And you are under a Gujju Mandal so food is not a problem at all. And Juhu beach is like the be-saharon ka sahara. Other eat-outs include Pizza Hut, Crepe station, Garcia’s, Subway, Khaasiyat, McDonald’s, ShivSagar, Naturals (The ice-cream of Juhu scheme). And if you still feel the list is still incomplete then most DJites are seen hogging mouthwatering delicious food items at its sister institute, Mukesh Patel\'s canteen. ',pos
'You will actually find the cream crowd of engineering at DJ Sanghvi with an exciting blend of fashion, money and brains! Life at DJ is pretty cool. You meet all sorts of people and always end up with folks you like. Lots of Gujjus around because of the 50\% Gujurati quota, but that\'s quite a good thing, actually. Students are ambitious, competitive and participate over enthusiastically in the festivals which mind you, is not extraordinary. The crowd hails from Northern - Western Mumbai to South Mumbai and some from the Central and Harbour belt as well. ',pos
'DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering has a phenomenal placement record, you won\'t be jobless for sure! Big names come to pick you up after graduation. NO worries about that! TCS & Accenture pick the maximum number of students with L&T and Patni Computers following at hand. Placements MAY sometimes be a matter of concern for Biomed and Chemical students though, because a few of them sometimes don\'t clear the minimum criteria for ANY company. That isn\'t the college\'s fault, though.Other major companies visiting the campus: JP Morgan, AMDOCS, Godrej, Microsoft, Capgemini, Ernst and Young, Morgan Stanley. Average salary is around 5 LPA and highest went to 33 LPA for 2013 batch. ',pos
'All we can say is that in DJ Sanghvi the next 4 years of engineering will definitely be the best days of your life. Don\'t miss it! Definitely should be one of the top 5 on the priority list of the student. ',pos
'Faculty is average... but few are exceptionally great... ',pos
'Amazing infrastructure compared to many colleges in Mumbai. Crowd is awesome too. ',pos
'Attendance is moderately strict in DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering. 75\% is recommended and students are given assignments and university papers to solve if the requirement is not met with. ',pos
'Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCoE) fondly known as DJ Sanghvi or just \"DJ\" is in J.V.P.D scheme, opposite the very famous Cooper Hospital along with the cluster of several reputed SVKM institutes. It takes about 10 minutes by rickshaw from Vile Parle railway station (W. Rly. & Harbour Rly.) ',pos
'Canteen is ok... not great. ',pos
'Faculty at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) is average with mechanical being the best since most of the professors are good. Other departments have one or two excellent professors and one or two are said to be really horrible ones. ',pos
'There have been new malls which have come up in the vicinity which houses many franchisee outlets with the likes of KFC, MOD and McDonalds here, so enough places to hangout here. These malls have come as a big relief to students who earlier had no option but go to Ghatkopar or Chembur. ',pos
'Hangouts are good enough. and with the new Phoenix mall being there, you can bunk and enjoy. ',pos
'Accenture, Infosys, L&T InfoTech and Hexaware. About 70\% of the students generally fall under the \"eligiblity criteria\" which is usually a requirement of 60\% marks or higher. Most of the eligible candidates are placed.Average salaries offered would be around Rs. 3 lac p.a. ',pos
'The classrooms are roomy and well ventilated. There is ample natural light pouring in courtesy of the large windows. The labs are modern and well equipped. Elements of contemporary design can be seen everywhere. There is a chapel on the ground floor.There is a huge football ground, basketball court and it is concretised. There are provisions for indoor games like carrom and table tennis at Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT). The campus has lush greenery throughout the year. Even the insides of the buildings are spruced up by placing potted plants. Recent changes have been to the landscape, by addition of a lawn at the upper echelons which double up as a playground and reception venue. ',pos
'The college was established just about 5 years earlier and is hence yet to gain popularity but it is one of the top 5 colleges for bachelor of pharmacy and its gradually gaining more recognition. If you go for this college you wont regret it, for BNCP rocks!!! ',pos
'SVKM rocks, though I\'m doing Engineering from VESIT but was a ex-student of Mithibai!! At that time my chem pracs used to be coanducted just opposite the pharmacy lab, students and the faculty over there were quite impressive but the foul smell of gases made me choose Engineering..;-p. A thumbs up for the candithates enrolling here ',pos
'Great infrastructure, the SVKM group never disappoints on this front. The college is entirely air-conditioned, though the entire campus has been under construction atleast since 5 years. Yet they have managed to make a pretty decent and good college with good classrooms and labs.All the laboratories and the classrooms have been furnished completely and constructed just a couple of years back, so its got well equipped labs and pretty decent classrooms. Lavish boys and girls common room with sofas and beds provide you with complete luxury. Campus is one of the major problems because this college is located in the campus of Mithibai college itself ',pos
'There is no particular canteen dedicated to the college but the NM canteen in the adjoining building serves delicious and really cheap food. ',pos
'A large and huge list of hangouts that you will find around the college, after all it is one of the best areas in Mumbai, Juhu! The dosa and the sandwich wallas occupy the entire street around the college. Don\'t forget to try the mayonnaise grilled sandwich, its awesome. Subway, on public demand there are now 2 subways, one near the station and one near Juhu beach. Pizza Hut, Dominos for pizzas, Crepe station for pastas and Hungama, Mocha for hookahs. ',pos
'There is a week-long intra-college festival ending with the annual day of the college. There\'s also Rx, which is the inter-college festival for all Maharashtra pharmacy colleges. Rx is probably the only single period during the year when you can actually have a lot of fun. Other events include the Interclass sports events, various college days like traditional day, formal day and beach day. ',pos
'The most important and interesting subject - \"Design\" has the finest faculty and terrific guest lectures, but other than that most of the teachers stay indifferent. Loads of junior professors with little or no experience teach the first years but the trend doesn\'t continue into the later years where well qualified and experienced teachers take over. ',pos
'Spyro, Rangoli, Dosa Plaza, CCD (which isn\'t easily discoverable) and a mini - Dominos outlet are popular amongst students here. And Vashi ofcourse is the ultimate saviour. ',pos
'Srujan is a popular festival celebrated at DY Patil College of Architecture somewhere around mid-Jan. Another fest which the students look forward to is \"Rhapsody\" - a cultural event. Apart from these various workshops and events are organized all round the year. ',pos
'DY Patil College of Architecture undoubtedly has the potential to do far better than how its currently doing, but that doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t a good college. Perhaps stands only second in preference to Bharati Vidyapeeth amongst architecture colleges in Navi Mumbai. ',pos
'Teachers put in appreciable efforts and students are equally thankful. Some couldn’t even find words to praise their teachers. A few others weren’t as grateful – “Teaching is mediocre. Not intolerable but not great either” exclaims a student.Visiting faculty, an important parameter for a law college, is spectacular. Notable figures who’ve given their inputs include Ujwal Nikam and Anup Mehta.Even apart from the prescribed course content, the faculty is very encouraging and students are taken to Jails and Court visits to gain some practical experience of what is being taught. ',pos
'DY Patil Law College is undoubtedly the best choice amongst law colleges in Navi Mumbai. Even while considering law colleges from Mumbai, it would hold a place amongst the top 5. ',pos
'The entire campus (which includes the massive DY Patil stadium) is too big to talk about; so let’s get straight to the infrastructure of the Law College. Most of the requirements of the students, from spacious moot courts to a well stocked library, are satisfactorily met with by the college. One noticeable thing missing is ‘Internet’ which, however, students don’t really seem to care about. Classrooms are tidy and have an appropriate environment for academics. ',pos
'“Not a reason to worry” quickly comments a student of the college. Over 75\% attendance is recommended as per the university rules but DY Patil Law College relaxes that figure to around 50\%. Final year students are given further relief as many have to catch up with external internships as well. ',pos
'DY Patil Law College shares it’s canteen with Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT), or rather it’s the other way round. The canteen has been newly renovated so it has a superb ambience. It’s huge and serves excellent food at reasonable rates. ',pos
'Navi Mumbaikars happen to form the major chunk of the crowd at DY Patil Law College, the rest being from different parts of the island city and the Western Suburbs. A few also come from outside the Mumbai metropolitan region as the DY Patil campus also provides fine hostel facilities, although common to all colleges in the campus. “Students here are academically oriented and are always eager to learn more about their subject” says a student. “But that doesn’t mean there’s no fun. We enjoy when it’s the right time to” she continues. ',pos
'‘Velawcity’ is the intercollege festival of DY Patil College of Law celebrated sometime in February. And although it doesn’t get too many entries from other colleges, the participation of students from this college is fantastic. ',pos
'DY Patil Law College provides its support to those who wish to get jobs by getting them in touch with some of the law firms. “After we’ve been introduced to a particular firm, the rest is up to us” says a student. Salaries range between Rs. 15k to 40k for freshers. Majority of the law graduates, however, opt for higher studies. ',pos
'Recently Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering has hired a lot of new faculty. The old professors are quite good in the sense that they do teach and students can understand if they attend. Some students find the teaching pretty okay in the Computer dept. while the Production dept. seems very strict. Few of the faculty members are helpful and open to doubts. ',pos
'Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering placement records have always been gratifying with more than 100\% placement every year. All renowned companies come here. TCS, Infosys, Amdocs, L&T Infotech pick up maximum students with salaries ranging between Rs. 2.5 lacs p.a. to Rs. 4 lacs p.a. In recent years, placements have picked up even more, with some more dream companies like Google, IBM, Hewlett Packard, JP Morgan, Nerolac coming in and offering better packages. Expect the trend to continue. ',pos
'A school, a chapel and the college building are in the same premises of Fr. Agnel College of Engineering. The diploma and degree classes are in the same building. It houses lecture halls, well-equipped laboratories of all departments, computer centres, a capacious library with many books and journals, dedicated internet centre for students, gymnasium, auditorium, canteen and other imperative amenities. Gymkhana is common for all and it is crowded most of the times. The campus is Wifi Enabled and the students are provided with specialized barcoded ID cards to avail the required amenities. Excellent computational facility with 3 MBps internet connectivity. Hostel facilities are available, but only for boys. ',pos
'Bandstand, mate. You have a breathtaking view of the sea from the classrooms and a cool breeze is constantly blowing. A 15 - 20 minute ride in a rickshaw should take you to Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (better known as Fr. Agnel College of Engineering) from Bandra railway station (Western Railway & Harbour Railway) but that would be a bit expensive. BEST bus 211 starts from Bandra station and drops you right outside the college gate which happens to be the last stop. Having said that, the frequency is simply superb. ',pos
'Excellent. Faculty is actually good in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering streams of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT). Although, the same cannot be said about the Computer and IT faculty, it\'s much better than many of so-called top institutes. Teachers make sure the portion is completed well within time. Presentations are made by the teachers so that the students understand better. Doubts are always welcome. The faculty makes sure that at the end of the semester the student is well versed with the subject. ',pos
'You can\'t expect the cream of the city to travel all the way to Koparkhairane to teach at a brand new college, can you? But it\'s not too bad. A couple of MU toppers were from Gahlot, so the faculty must be at least half-decent, we\'re guessing. Students say that the professors are pretty qualified, though it must be noted that many of them are just MBAs, perhaps from institutes very similar to this one! Communication is mostly in English, but some professors are nice enough to speak in Hindi if students have language issues. The college hasn\'t had any guest lecturers coming in yet, but efforts are being made, so you can expect a few in a couple of years. ',pos
'While there\'s nothing great about the infrastructure at GIMSR, it isn\'t too bad either. The newly-made building certainly looks better than the others around it, but that isn\'t really saying much. The one appreciable point is perhaps that the college has a generator, so they don\'t lose power during load shedding. Classrooms are decent, and the library is okay too. No wifi connectivity, we\'re afraid. There\'s also a small ground behind the college, where they host their \'sports day\'. ',pos
'Gahlot Institute of Management Studies and Research (GIMSR) is just a 15 minutes walk from Koparkhairane. There are also a few buses which go to this college but if you have company from the railway station it is advisable to take an autorickshaw as it comes to just Rs.15/- ',pos
'There are a lot of senior faculties in this college. They are all very co-operative and helpful. Guest lectures are also conducted 2 or 3 times a week and some of the visiting faculties are even better than permanent ones. ',pos
'The campus is shared with school and the Arts, Science, Commerce College. The infrastructure of this college is nothing exceptional but nothing is lacking about it too. There are all the equipment and facilities needed pertaining to the course such as projectors, air-conditioned classrooms, wi-fi connectivity etc. The library is smallish but it is sufficiently spacious looking at the strength of current batches. Overall the infrastructure is good and students rate it 7 on 10. ',pos
'Even though this is a relatively new college, placements are good and are expected to get better as the college becomes older and reputed. Although not 100\%, most of the students do get a job. Average package is around 4.5 lakh rupees.College also provides 100\% summer placements. Some of the companies that visited the college for summer’s are Godrej, Reliance, Mahindra & Mahindra and Cadbury. ',pos
'Overall atmosphere is conducive for studies and offers possibilities for freaking out too. Although the college is relatively new it has potential to become one of the better known colleges around the city. ',pos
'Bunking full on! Assignments, punishments or test papers are to be solved if attendance is below 50 \%. But you can always chhapofy! Actions are only taken if you are in critical defaulter say less than 30\%-40\%. ',pos
'Its located right opposite Lilavati hospital in Bandra (W). Its slightly far from the railway station (Bandra-W Rly and Harbour Rly) and you wouldn\'t want to walk to the college. Takes about 15 minutes by rick, i.e., if you find one...it becomes a major task on most days. One of the best locations among all the architecture colleges though. ',pos
'Candies, Barista, Garcia’s, Five Spice, Sai Sagar restaurant near by, Carter Road, Linking Road and Hill Road. Bandstand is not far. And after all its Bandra, the queen of the suburbs...it will never let you run of options. ',pos
'Overall, a very good college and must be among the top choices of the student, because of its magnificent location. Though travelling is somewhat a problem for students coming from the central suburbs, especially when you have to carry big projects along. For others it’s a good choice. ',pos
'Faculty of KJSCE is pretty decent and are really experienced. Mechanical Faculty of KJSCE is said to be one of the most experienced faculty with abundant practical knowledge and having an average tenure of 9 years and more. Lectures are conducted in English and most of the professors are M.Tech/PhD holders who strike a chord with the students. ',pos
'Being a gujju (Gujarati minority) college, 50\% of the seats are reserved for Gujaratis though you always see more than 70\% of Gujjus in this college. As per engineering standards the crowd is really good at KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE). You’ll find all kinds of people here, from nerds to the so called cool people and also the smart lot. Even the gunda variety is said to be found here. Over the last couple of years, the crowd at KJSCE has improved and along with the general mix of students from other colleges in the campus, the college has a very vibrant feel to it, especially in the canteens. ',pos
'the crowd here is very true ................its awesome. ',pos
'the festivals are rocking....surge2011 was fantastic.... KJSIEIT is a good choice... ',pos
'Both somaiya vidyavihar and somaiya sion management is centered, that\'s why GOOD PLACEMENT. ',pos
'According to students, the management is a little soft on defaulters. Assignment punishments are given if attendance is below 60 \% (at least in the 1st year) but most copy (nothing new) and escape the punishment. The college has never made any harsh decision by not allowing students to sit for the exam or asked for a fine. ',pos
'KJ Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE), more popularly known as \"KJ\", is closest to Vidhyavihar railway station (C.Rly.), at a 10 minute walk and with the share-a-rickshaw facility available, the travel time between decreases to a mere 5 minutes. The college is also well connected by the Harbour Line via Chembur and Tilak Nagar Stations. A bus stop is also located outside the Ghatkopar Gate and one is also located near Amar Mahal which is a 10 minute walk from the college. This bus stop is well connected to Thane and South Mumbai. The Western Line is also easily accessible from the Ghatkopar Metro Station ',pos
'The canteen is pretty good. Food is delicious and the rates are also reasonable. This place packs more attendance than most lectures. With a variety of food types and snacks available, finding a seat during lunch a a task in itself.Coupled with low cost, good food and great hygiene, the mess is easily the favourite of every student looking to eat a huge lunch on a low budget. With two messes located inside the campus, KJSCE is a great place for every student who enjoys a good variety of vegetarian food. ',pos
'On the hangout spots of this college, the Maggi house near the Aryabhatta building of the college is very popular with the students. The amphitheatre(Gargi Plaza) sees a huge number of visitors enjoying the breeze and having a nice time with friends. With Pheonix Market City and Odeon Mall in the vicinity, students often go to these places to hang out or watch a movie. Vikrant Circle at Ghatkopar is also popular with the students for a variety of options available for good food. ',pos
'The faculty at KJ Somaiya College, Sion is good in Computers and EXTC. The faculty in Electronics is said to be strict whereas they are said to be lenient in IT. Overall, an experienced and qualified faculty. ',pos
'KJ Somaiya College of Engineering, Sion is relatively new so it is not the automatic choice but it definitely comes in the second rung colleges. You will find a healthy blend of studies and enjoyment in this college. ',pos
'It is recommended that you keep your attendance above 75\% and it should definitely not fall below 50\% otherwise parents are summoned. It is mandatory to wear Id-Cards in college the whole day, even in the canteen!! ',pos
'The canteen at KJ Somaiya College, Sion is pretty ordinary and there is much scope for improvement. The food is edible and cheap. You can eat here!! ',pos
'The crowd is fun loving and jovial. Enjoyment is guaranteed and you will almost always find a great group to bond with. Boys to girls ratio is 1:3. ',pos
'Infosys and TCS account for majority of the placements 70\% of the students get placements. ',pos
'Going by the general opinion of the students, the faculty is slightly better for the PGDM course, as compared to MMS, but the syllabus is almost parallel. Apart from Finance, all the major subjects faculties, the students say are good. Finance is a bit of trouble. All of them are highly qualified, and some even Ph.D holders. Although some students would say that the professors can’t express themselves well. But you cannot rule out their experience, and their very approachable attitude. Guest faculties are common with colleges like JBIMS, Wellingkar and Sydenham, so you certainly expect brilliance from these teachers taking their respective subjects. ',pos
'The college comprises of two buildings, of which the newer building takes the charm compared to the older one, but both are maintained well. All the classrooms are air-conditioned so that the studying environment remains conducive. The college has not made the provision for wifi internet connectivity, citing certain security issues, which the students feel could be managed. That does not mean students do not have access to the internet, the computer labs do have internet, but the speed is pretty annoying. The library has more than enough books available for all, even during exam times. The students also have access to an e-library system, which is available to all the students. But the PGDM students enjoy a slightly more convenient facility, by which they get to keep all the books for themselves, that are needed for the semester, pretty cool in a way. The sports facilities are good too with a cricket and a football ground. ',pos
'The campus is an entire complex, which is certainly the biggest campus in all of Mumbai University colleges, and the sporting facilities are also good, as mentioned earlier. About the life, that’s pretty hectic here in the first year, where students have to face a lot of completely new subjects, so getting used to that takes some time, but it is pretty calm thereon. The college canteen is disliked by the students, and they prefer the engineering/polytechnic canteen which they say is way better. For hanging out, there’s R-city mall, Phoenix Mall, and eating out usually happens in Ghatkopar. ',pos
'Even while we were talking to the students regarding this review, 200 out of the batch of 300 had already got placed, and the students are very certain that 100\% of the batch will be placed. Although the college does all they can, while getting companies to recruit students, there are some people who are very particular about their preferences, at times, do not land up in a job.But one thing peculiar about the college, is the procedure followed (which the students believe is not seen in any other b-school), which then causes things to come at the behest of LUCK. In the defence of the college, the system is in place to provide every single student irrespective of his/her performance, a very fair chance. Thus, the no. of companies coming to college is HIGH, but the process reduces the average student placed.The average range of pay packages/salary here is around Rs. 6-7 Lakh per year, while the highest has gone to about Rs.8,00,000 per year, which is pretty decent. ',pos
'Certainly K. J. Somaiya Institute of Management Studies and Research has a place in the top 5 MBA colleges in Mumbai, and top 3 if considering under the University of Mumbai. Good college, nice facilities, decent amount of industry exposure, and in the end, placements, if that’s what you’re into, SIMSR is the better colleges to be in. ',pos
'Kamla Raheja is one of the best architecture colleges in Mumbai, and it has a faculty to match its reputation. The professors are highly experienced, and all have Masters degrees from good foreign universities. They communicate well with the students, and the students are thrilled with them. ',pos
'Excellent college to go to, in spite of the strict attendance system and lack of air-conditioners. Ideally, one of the best architecture colleges in the State. ',pos
'Kamala Raheja College of Architecture is located in Juhu, right next to the famous Vidyanidhi group of schools. The college is pretty far from Andheri and Vile Parle stations, hence many students prefer travelling by buses as their frequency is upto the mark. Students do travel by trains and it can cost you a fair 25 bucks from Vile Parle Station in rickshaw, which you can manage to share with a couple of friends. So getting to the college is not an issue. ',pos
'The crowd is pretty good; a decent mix of girls and boys. Although students may be involved in extra-curriculars as well, most of them are quite sincere. ',pos
'All the faculties are highly qualified; especially the marketing faculty. There are a good number of visiting faculties from the industry as well. Marketing teachers have an in depth knowledge about their respective subject and students usually love their style of teaching. ',pos
'The infrastructure at Welingkar is very good. There are two libraries, audio visual rooms, air-conditioned classrooms equipped with LCD and projectors. As such there is no campus within the college, but overall it’s kept quite neat, clean and green. The college has separate hostel for boys and girls, with LAN internet connectivity. The library is over 20 years old, and has over 40000 volumes covering different management topics, and it automated using barcode, for quick information management. The open air amphitheater is a nice setup for students to perform and unleash their creative sides. The auditorium is well equipped and considered world class. Apart from that, the college also has a yoga and a recreation centre. ',pos
'Welingkar College is located in Matunga East but is equally accessible from Matunga and Dadar. It’s a 5 minute walk from Dadar station and BEST bus frequency is excellent. Students probably use both trains and buses for commuting to the college. ',pos
'Crowd is excellent. Everyone is very friendly and students feel like home. People come from all the different backgrounds like engineering, commerce, industry. In a nutshell, you meet hell lot of down to earth students. Apart from the canteen, there is a recreational centre within the campus where you see students playing and chit chatting. There are hundreds of food parlours / stalls right outside the college. ',pos
'Placement for batch of 2012 was more than 100\% with highest package of 20 LPA. Roughly, the average pay package at Welingkar is 7.75 LPA. Major recruiters are Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Deloitte, Tata Motors. HUL, Capgemini & IBM. All in all, the placements are quite good as compared to the other top B-schools in Mumbai. ',pos
'Well the people here who are saying all these things, need to get their facts right. The very first thing is that the highest packages..... Well 4 guys in my batch of 120 students bagged packages ranging from 10-15 Lpa. and most of the guys bagged 7-8Lpa. While those who had some preferences about a particular sector compromised on the packages and that\'s acceptable. Still those guys never got less than 6Lpa. Someone has to be really dumb/choosy at Welingkar who cannot bag a job. Certainly most of the students at Welingkar are locals who do not want to move out of Mumbai, so most of them do not opt for organizations asking for relocation. Now you can\'t blame a college for that. ',pos
'As far as I know Welingkar is one of the best colleges I have come across. Their programs are good. They also have great infrastructure and brilliant faculty. The professors go out of their way to help you with concepts. The exposure is very good. The college has immensely helped me with networking and has also boosted my self confidence. ',pos
'I was pretty hesitant when I selected Welingkar. But I have to it is one of the best colleges in Mumbai. I have done my pat time masters form there. With the course, I was able to balance my work and education at the same time. I got very good exposure. The college has immensely helped me with networking and has also boosted my self confidence. ',pos
'the crowd is quite good....people do come here from south mumbai,maximum crowd is from suburbs(bandra to borivali)....its true you won\'t find a lot of studs and babes here...bt you will njoy a lot wid this mixed type of crowd. ',pos
'Guys SLRTCE is the best... We celebrate Tech Fest & Cultural fest which is titled as UTSAV. ',pos
'There is an excellent faculty in this college and can be said to be the USP of the college. For each 10-12 students a faculty is assigned who mentors them for all the academic issues. Core faculty are highly experienced and knowledgeable. There are more junior professors compared to seniors but they’re also equally competent and helpful. Students are extremely pleased with their teaching and highly grateful to have such amazing faculty. ',pos
'Crowd is fine ',pos
'There is a nice looking building which looks even more beautiful in contrast the surrounding locality. It’s a 7 storey building out of which 1st and 2nd floors are for architecture and interior design courses. Infra is not excellent but it’s quite good compared to other colleges. Classrooms are not air-conditioned but are comfortable & airy nonetheless. Labs & studios are also well-equipped and well-lit. Library is spacious and has adequate number of books. The campus lacks WiFi connectivity but internet can be accessed from internet labs. However only 4th and 5th year students get to use this facility. One thing lacking is playground & recreational facilities. But overall the students are satisfied with the infrastructure at hand as they are provided with all the required amenities. ',pos
'Canteen is really nice and spacious. Tasty food is served at reasonable prices and there is also a good variety of dishes. Only one complain – no non-veg food is available. ',pos
'External faculty is excellent for all years. However permanent faculty seems to be just above average. Some of the permanent ones are just too good with you if you maintain good relations with them. ',pos
'The campus is pretty small. However there is a small playground on the opposite side. The college seems to be under construction for the past 4-5 years so half of the structure is unfit for normal architects to work in. Soon college is going to be ready with its new look. Hostel facilities are available. But that doesn\'t mean the resources for learning are not available, the labs are good, with internet and multimedia features. ',pos
'Crowd is good. Generally people from western and central suburbs come to this college. People are just too cool to hang out with. ',pos
'It is going to be among the best colleges soon…The rate at which new principal is making improvements seems as though we have entered into a totally different level of learning things…a very good college to look-up to in the near future…join in you’ll have a great time ahead!!! ',pos
'Like most colleges in the outskirts, Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) doesn’t exactly attract the best crowd. While its not bad, the majority of people come from Vashi, Thane and Koparkhairane. It’s a fairly mixed crowd though. Acceptable. ',pos
'This is probably the college’s USP. Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) has a really good infrastructure, with well maintained classrooms and, more importantly, washrooms. The labs are clean and well-equipped too. To top it all, they have a Massive campus, with basketball and badminton courts, a full-size football ground and other indoor sports like table tennis and carrom. However, lots of parts of the campus are still under construction and students face a plethora of problems currently. ',pos
'The food is not bad. Its sufficiently hot and most things are edible. Hygiene isn’t great, but that really shouldn’t be of much concern for engineering students. ',pos
'The teaching staff is overall good. Architectural and interior design faculty is comparatively better. The humanities and theory faculty is best. Students are not satisfied with the structure faculty. The teachers clear the doubts even after the lectures and are quite co-operative. Visiting faculty is also good. ',pos
'coanditions have changed...lot of faculty from dy patil has joined this college...the new bldg of this college is almost ready....teaching is good....the college always has old guest arcitect lectures...n ya the elevators function quiet smootly now ',pos
'well derz new CCD(xpress) opeand recently.............grate places inside campus 2 bnk........and hv fun.........aint bad though........... ',pos
'Placement is good..!! ',pos
'SEE.. I\'m a 1st year student...I\'m going to tell you what I personally feel about this college...A UNIQUE life experience..So big campus.. 1 of the biggest in Mumbai university..!!You will interact with medical, dental, physiotherapy, nursing, mass media, bsc students..!!A big playground !! OK ok canteen you can also go to cafeteria or nearby McD.. ',pos
'The infrastructure at MET is pretty good. Lecture halls are air-conditioned and well-maintained, the entire building is wifi enabled, and they have an excellent, well-equipped library. They also have a games room and a music room, where you can often find students jamming away to glory. There is a basketball court, a tennis court, and a little ground where you can play whatever you feel like as well. ',pos
'The placements vary from course to course, but the average package at MET is about Rs.4 lakh per year. Companies such as HDFC, TCS, Cognizant, ICICI Bank visit the college. The college has roughly 60-70\% placements. ',pos
'I must say its a pretty good college for Management. After top 4 Its rank is well placed. Infra For B school Excellent. Faculty Most of them too good namely you will find all famous book authors from graduate level courses teach there. Only problem is you don\'t see much students with work experience. MMS being university course work load is less But PGDM is too demanding and instance course. MET is well known for its PG in Marketing ',pos
'‘If the first year faculty is good, then second year is better’, quoted by one of the students. Good English communication and experienced professors gives a ‘thumbs up’ to the teaching department of pharmacy in MET. ',pos
'It\'s not an average college. Faculty is great!! ',pos
'The pharmacy department is situated on the 4th floor of this building while the other floors are dedicated to the MBA department. The classrooms are pretty decent and have one sitter benches. Apart from the AC classrooms and labs, there are projectors in all the lecture rooms. Labs are excellently maintained and well equipped too.The college also has a basketball court, tennis court and a huge playground. Moreover, there is a music room on the 5th floor, where you can pick up an instrument and start jamming. ',pos
'The college has one common canteen for Pharmacy and MBA students. In spite of that, it is quite spacious as the lunch breaks are strategically timed. The food is decent and quite affordable. Spring Dosa is a speciality of the MET canteen. ',pos
'There are a number of hangouts very close to the college. Candies is one of the favourites thanks to its location. Sai Sagar nearby even gives a discount to IES students! ',pos
'The pharmacy crowd in MET is quite balanced as they participate in extra-curricular activities and perform exceedingly well in academics. Most of the students are from the local city Mumbai, while you hardly see any ambitious student coming from different states of India. On a whole, girls outdo the number of boys in class strength. ',pos
'The teaching staff is okay with little arrogance and towering attitude. Some students’ find them friendly while few keep at least a hand away distance. Most of the lecturers in Nirmala College communicate in English while some prefer the desi style. ',pos
'If your marks are just about average plus you stay in the nearby suburbs and don’t want to face the typical strictness like in a few other colleges, then Nirmala College is a good bet. ',pos
'I love this college cause all the staff is very much friendly and helpful. Guys it\'s upon you what image you create in front of them and they\'ll just react the same way as you react to them. All the teachers are damn good. I\'m happy to be a student of NMFC in 12th science. Love you all teaching and non-teaching staff ',pos
'This is one of the factors which goes in the favour of students. Attendance is NOT AT ALL strict and maintaining a 45-50\% is tolerated. Anything below this mark, parents are called but most of the students are left with warnings. ',pos
'Nirmala College is located 10-15 minutes away from Kandivali Railway station in Thakur Complex in Kandivali East. The frequency of BEST buses from Kandivali and Borivali stations is pretty awesome and majority of the students use this mode of transportation. Some dudes like to flaunt their bikes and there is decent parking space outside the college gate. ',pos
'Since, the college is located in Thakur Complex, you can definitely expect quite a few good and local restaurants/stalls. Right opposite the college is the Tibbs Frankie along with a refreshing Soda pub. A few more local sandwich, vada pav and patties tapris completes the local hangouts. Two minutes away is the most famous and unnecessarily expensive Urban Tadka. Also, you can find a plethora of cafes and pizza parlours once you enter Thakur Village located on the other side of the highway. Movie buffs can definitely enjoy their life in (or outside actually) Nirmala College because of Cinemax, Fame and Broadway. ',pos
'As there is no Minority Quota in Nirmala College, you can expect a mix crowd. Majority of the students come from the nearby suburbs and most of the bikers are seen wooing girls. You can expect the crowd to be less studious due to the leeway given on attendance. ',pos
'Oriental College of Pharmacy is particular about attendance but not strict. The university norm of 75\% is recommended by the college but a small 5\% relaxation is allowed before parents are summoned. However, no harsh actions are said to be taken, probably because most of the students compensate for short of attendance soon. ',pos
'placements are also very good......near about 70\% people get placed this year....... ',pos
'Average college with the only positive being great placement facilities. Students with no social life would find this college apt and perfect!! ',pos
'I think canteen is not that bad as compared to many colleges in Mumbai.It\'s the best college if you want to study 4 years rather than to enjoy Engineering. ',pos
'The only decent and nearest hangout place would be the Multiplexes “Imax” at Wadala and “Cinemax” at Sion. Good restaurants can be found but only in Sion, which isn’t very close to the college. The canteen serves as the regular hangout for most of the students due to the lack of any other joints near the college. ',pos
'Patkar is one of the top rated colleges in the western suburbs and should be a good choice after a few top rung colleges. Though the crowd and infrastructure is not appealing, but the name Patkar – Varde, has its legacy going since years. ',pos
'Patkar College is located in Goregaon West on SV Road and is less than 5 minutes walking from Goregaon Railway station. The college has a good name and is quite famous amongst the FYJC and SYJC students. Most of the students commute by train while a few choose to travel BEST buses as its frequency is amazing. ',pos
'The canteen of Patkar – Varde College is decently spacious but is too suffocating. The canteen lacks enough tube lights and seems dull during most parts of the day. The food is just edible while cost is not an issue. You can expect a lot of time pass items like chocolates, chips and biscuits inside the canteen apart from the regular food. Gossip mongers choose canteen for their private chit chat. ',pos
'The faculty at M.E.S. Pillai’s Institute Of Information Technology (PIIT) is really good for a college on the outskirts of the city, with the students and teachers sharing a good rapport. The mechanical department faculty, it seems, is one of the best in (well not technically, but anyway) Mumbai. ',pos
'u have many drop outs so the crowd isn\'t smart either! so you can be an instant star if your intelligent or a football player!but come to the college and u\'ll notice it is unlike any engineering college, a fun place to be in, chill out and study( if you will do that ever ) :) ',pos
'The placements hadn\'t been impressive till recently but they\'ve shown some improvement in last couple of years. The college manages to place close to 50\% of the students with decent salaries. Of course, those who DO get placed are pretty happy, with companies like Accenture offering acceptable salaries of 3.2 lac per annum.',pos
'Good college maaaje mein raho study karo and try to score 60\% you will surely Get placed.Companies like TCS, Amdocs ,Godrej,Indian NAvy,Persistent, Inscript,Accenturs recruit students .par FEES bahut hai bhai so take this into consideration ',pos
'One massive plus point about M.E.S. Pillai’s Institute Of Information Technology (PIIT) is its Massive campus, which is surprisingly clean by engineering college standards. The washrooms are NOT cramped and do NOT smell like a fart bomb. All in all, it’s a nice environment to study (or not study) in. ',pos
'Attendance is not really an issue, with 40-50\% guaranteeing safety. ',pos
'Located conveniently close to Panvel Railway Station, Pillai’s Institute of Information Technlogy (PIIT) is a cool 10 minute walk from the tracks. If you wish to save even more time, and spend some more money, you could take a rickshaw which would get you there in not more than a couple of minutes. ',pos
'The canteen at M.E.S. Pillai’s Institute Of Information Technology (PIIT) is of an acceptable standard, with edible and more importantly, affordable, food. ',pos
'The infrastructure is quite decent with their auditorium, something worth a mention. All the other basic amenities are available like Wi-Fi on campus, air-conditioned classrooms equipped with projectors. All students are provided with laptops (they are planning to discontinue this due to complaints from students). ',pos
'There is a Linguistic Minority-Malayalam at Pillai’s Institute Of Management Studies And Research, as is the case with other institutes at the Pillai campus. The crowd is a good mixture of students from various backgrounds. ',pos
'While it would be silly to expect professors to shun the IIMs and come here to teach, it\'s fair to say that the faculty at Rajeev Gandhi College of Management Studies isn\'t too bad. Professors are qualified, though teaching may not really be their forte. They are extremely supportive though, as any student would tell you. There are hardly any guest lecturers coming in- a grand total of two visited the college last year. ',pos
'Rajeev Gandhi College of Management Studies (RGCMS) is located at a 15 minute walk from Ghansoli railway station (which is on the awesome-sounding trans-harbour line). Students also travel by buses, since their frequency from Vashi and Thane is pretty good, and they drop you right outside college. ',pos
'Strictly okay except for 2010 when it showed 80-85\% placements. Placements in the instrumentation branch are relatively bad. Some good companies do come to pick students from college but most students are culled and only a handful are placed. In 2009 about 130 students were placed in good companies. About 45\% placements in 2007 and 60\% in 2008. Infosys is the major taker. Placements are improving year on year, though, so it\'s worth the risk. ',pos
'placement is comparatively good with av salary of 3.5 LPA for comps.good for comps ,IT,mech then EXTC. ',pos
'RGIT has one of the very good canteens in Mumbai colleges. It is well ventilated and decently spaced. Various food items like Pav Bhaji, Chaat, South Indian and Pizza are the most preferred ones. Prcies are extremely moderate for the super quality food and thus it has always turned out to be a saviour for most of the studnets. ',pos
'Owing to it RGITs upmarket location, the college has some fantatic hangouts .Versova beach and \'Versova rocks\' followed by Yari road are all very close to the college and will cost a minimum rickshaw fare to get you there. Eatery joints like Kareems and drinking joints like Pop Tates and Sodas have always attracted the students. Lokhandwala is another excellent hangout next to the college where you can expect almost everything under the sun. Movie buffs can look out for Fun Republic (also famous for its Bowling Alley) and Fame Cinemas at Citi Mall. ',pos
'RAIT has some really dedicated professors. Over the last few years, the standard of the college has increased tremendously and thus excellent teaching staff have been employed in this college. There are some okay teachers. Communication takes place in English. Teachers are not very strict; but at the same time they\'re not into favourtism. That\'s about it. ',pos
'RAIT is just AWESOME!Everything about it is brilliant. Especially the Engineering canteen food. ',pos
'A masala mix of scholars, cyber junkies, diehard headbangers, take-it-easy goers, flunkers, Martians, Gujjus etc. can be found at Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT)Life in RAIT begins at 9:00 AM and seems to end at 6:00 PM (People never leave, they seem to fade away. RAIT is never lifeless). People are into Computers, rock music...rock music and computers. Half of RAIT comprises cyber nuts the other half sleep on guitars. ',pos
'crowd of RAIT is just great.......friendfull, supportive. ',pos
'Records are good and average salary offered was around Rs. 3.25 lac p.a. for the previous year. The major recruiter is Infosys. Great progress has been made in the recent years and students claim that RAIT placements are now at par with the best colleges in Mumbai. ',pos
'164 students got placed in TCS and arouand 16 students in HCL. ',pos
'Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology (RAIT) is not monotonously boring. In fact it is daringly different. A healthy mix of both education and entertainment. So if you plan to be an engineer with a difference then RAIT is the place to be in. ',pos
'attendance? Don\'t need it. If you get good marks in tests it doesn\'t matter how many lectures you\'ve bunked. Self-study is very important here ',pos
'Strangely enough RAIT canteen (managed by Anna) serves good food at very reasonable rates. Thali, Vada Pav, Masala Dosa are favourites. The ambience has been recently upgraded and now attracts students from every department be it medicine or law and of course engineering. The change has been so drastic that alumni who haven\'t been to their college for long, can\'t believe it\'s the same canteen.  ',pos
'Rizvi College of Architecture has very good faculty. All teachers are highly qualified and have at least done their Masters in architecture or interior designing. They’re good in communication and you easily understand what they’re teaching. They’re also flexible about medium of instruction and teach in either English or Hindi as per students demand. Apart from permanent staff there are also many guest faculties to conduct seminars. ',pos
'It is in the same campus as the engineering, management, hotel management, law colleges and school. There is a 7 storeyed building of which top 2 floors are dedicated to architecture department. Classrooms and studios are well maintained and washrooms are clean. There’s no wi-fi but internet can be accessed from labs and there’s no restriction on usage of internet. The hostels are provided by the college in Mahim for boys and in Vile Parle for girls. Charges for which are Rs 3000 a month plus food extra. ',pos
'Very few colleges in Mumbai can beat the location of Rizvi College of Architecture. It’s off the plush Carter road promenade and behind Pali Hill, home of many celebrities. One might often bump up with a celebrity or someone popular. It’s a little far from the railway stations though. It’s closer from Khar though it can be accessed from Bandra as well (both the stations lie on W. Rly and Harbour Rly). You can reach college in an auto for somewhere around 20 bucks or take bus no. 220 from Khar or Bandra stations. 51 & 56 are other buses from Dadar and Santacruz. ',pos
'The Rizvi College of Engineering canteen is a paradise for non - veggies. It’s really big and mostly very crowded. You can get some of the tastiest food here. It’s airy and well ventilated. The prices won’t be heavy on your pocket and yes no one brings TIFFIN in Rizvi, so good is the canteen. The seating is very comfortable. Food available varies from Chaat to Chinese, traditional thalis and what not. Don’t forget to try the Bhurji-pav here. ',pos
'As Rizvi College of Engineering is located in Bandra there are myriad places to go out to. CCD, Barista, Sheeshas, Candies are the closest to the college, less than a minute away. You can reach hill road or linking road in minimum auto fare to find famous hangouts like Yokos, KFC, McDonalds, Falafels, American Bakery, J.Hearshe, Mumbai Times Cafe, Hukkah n Tikkah and many more. There are dozens of Frankie, sandwich and dosa stalls just outside the college offering you with excellent and cheap options, most famous of being “Anna’s Dosa Corner”. Many LAN gaming centres have also turned up here and have become a big adda for the bunkers. Also the famous tambe gulli is there for those who like to smoke and dope. ',pos
'Even though there is 50\% quota for muslims, the principal is very open minded in accepting students from all parts of India. And so crowds are a changing in the college. There is great interaction between seniors and juniors. This rapport really encourages the extra curriculars that the college pariticpates in. ',pos
' Rizvi is one of the top private colleges in Bombay for Architecture. Although a small campus, it more than makes up for it in the academic and extra curricular front. ',pos
'A couple of years ago there were pretty good teachers but due to some unknown reasons the staff keeps changing. But now the teachers are Ph.D graduate and experianced. ',pos
'Its good college ya sum teachers are fresher but they try to teach which you will find in every college. ',pos
'Here comes the best part about Rizvi College of Engineering. You can come and go any time you want to, you are your own \"marzi ka malik\". Some teachers do threaten about attendance but that is just a formality. Years pass on and attendance keeps on falling. It\'s no big deal in Rizvi rather it turns out to be a plus point for students who want to study on their own. You can just come for practicals and study at home for the remaining time. So many students score out here. Imagine going to college right from 9am to 5pm and then rest of the evening being spent completing assignments. You can\'t even think of studying under such circumstances. Life is simple at Rizvi. ',pos
'Although the college has had difficulties in attracting guest lecturers, students are quite happy with the permanent faculty currently teaching there. The professors are qualified and knowledgeable, and are also quite helpful if students need any. ',pos
'Although Rohidas Patil Institute of Management is in the same complex as Shankar Narayan College of Commerce, the infrastructure varies significantly. All classrooms here are air-conditioned, and they have excellent computer labs and a nice library as well. There is wifi connectivity in the entire MBA section. ',pos
'Rohidas Patil Institute of Management Studies isn’t too far from Bhayandar railway station, and most students choose to take the 20 minute walk to college, because it’s always easy to find agreeable company. However, for those who are perpetually running late, share-rickshaws can get you there in about 5 minutes for just Rs.5 per head. ',pos
'Since the management branch is relatively new, not much can be said about the placements. But the college does try its best to get as high a percentage of placements as possible, with the average salary said to be about Rs.3 lakh per year. Amul, HDFC and Axis Bank are some of the companies that recently visited the campus. ',pos
'Students do not hold too many grudges against their faculty. They are fond of their teachers and seem happy and satisfied with the teaching. Visiting faculty and guest lecturers are fantastic too. ',pos
'Placements, in turn, are appreciable. The college easily manages to place over 90\% of the students with packages ranging between Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 6 lakh per year. The pay package offered to PGDM Pharmaceutical Management and Biotechnology Management students is a little lesser. ',pos
'Placement is just great for Marketing,close to 100\% and very good for Finance and HR though you\'ll find mostly girls opting for HR. ',pos
' “It is a paradise for management studies” says an extremely happy student here. Not THAT great, we would say, when compared to other top B-Schools all over the country. But, undoubtedly, a great option for those looking to stay in Mumbai. It could be preferred amongst the top 10 management colleges in Mumbai. ',pos
'The faculty is excellent in teaching for both PGDM and MMS and always ready to help and approachable.The professors here are very knowledgeable with close to 20-30 years experience and visiting faculty also come from time to time. ',pos
'attendance is must.Above 75\%.Overall a great college.I\'m pretty happy that I landed up here. ',pos
'SIES College of Management Studies (SIESCOMS) is a comfortable 7 minute and 15-rupee rickshaw ride from Nerul Railway Station (Harbour Line) in Navi Mumbai. Additionally the fifteen rupees will most probably get split amongst 3 as you’re bound to someone heading to either your college or the one next to it – DY Patil. Although a gentle walk to the college is also an option, there are hardly any takers. ',pos
'Campus is great and the Canteen serves good food. ',pos
'Crowd is a mix of girls and boys equally and people from all backgrounds ',pos
'Relatively good canteen with more-than-edible food. Misal pav is an all-time favourite. ',pos
'college in rainy season just seems like a picnic spot. The greenary and waterfall is just awesome, just like lonavala. A totally peaceful place to study. ',pos
'Good looking girls in the college. Trust Me! ;-) ',pos
'The crowd at Saraswati College of Engineering (SCoE) is decent, quite cosmopolitan. Very enthusiastic and love to participate actively in festivals of their own college as well as other colleges. ',pos
'believe me this collegeeg will allote 95\% placement in next three years ',pos
'faculty are very nice, friendly, helpful ',pos
'Place of college is too good.It\'s place just to do study, no other things can be done so mostly students are not bunking the lectures and if they bunk then directly go to home. Waterfall is there, but old students are not bunking there lectures for that. Too good place to do your study..... ',pos
'The canteen\'s food quality is good. ',pos
'The faculty at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology is pretty good. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems. ',pos
'Being one of the top rated colleges in Mumbai, SPIT has a very studious crowd. Definitely you will meet many nerds and geeks. A bunch of cream crowd can also be expected followed by students from the reserved category. Eventhough it is located in the western suburbs and has a \'not-so-accessible\' location, students from every possible nook and corner of the city are seen here. Good fun loving life. \"Khao, Piyo, aur Aish Karo\", quotes a student. ',pos
'space festival s thebest......agnee band s cuming this year...!!!!the industrial visit is theplus point of college,n placement is decent. ',pos
'Excellent records and scores over most colleges. It is one of the oldest colleges in Mumbai and hence has a fantastic name and a legacy attached to it. Round about 50\%-60\% of the students apply for placements, while the rest go for higher studies. Over 100\% placement record, with many students getting multiple job offers. Students from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT) are placed into companies like Infosys, Accenture, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and so on. Average salary is around Rs. 4 lakh p.a. A number of companies offering really fat salaries are also part of the campus recruitment. ',pos
'Excellent academics and fantastic placements gives Sardar Patel Institute of Technology an upper edge over most engineering colleges in Mumbai. The crowd is a let down but it\'s definitely one of the top 5 priority list of a student. A must join. ',pos
'Hostels are good & kept clean regularly.. Mess is also good because it\'s only closed on Saturday evening ',pos
'Sardar Patel Institute of Technology (SPIT) has one of the largest campus amongst the engineering colleges in Mumbai of which SPCE is also a part besides Bhavan\'s college and one of the most sought-after B-School in the country SP Jain Institute of Mgmt & Research (SPJIMR). SPITs building is well furnished and the infrastructural facilities are top notch. Lack of ACs might pull it down a bit but the natural environment is a plus point. Overall pretty decent infrastructure. Classrooms are good and washrooms are very much decent as compared to SPCE. Library is very much equipped with truckload of books.The campus also has a hostel facility considering it hosts two engineering, one management and a degree college respectively. ',pos
'Not too strict about attendance (big plus point! ',pos
'The canteen is pretty big as compared to other colleges, but with 7 branches (SPCE and SPIT combined), it seems a little small. The menu is good ranging from punjabi to chinese to Indian to South Indian. There is a sandwich counter as well. The menu is decently priced. Apart from the canteen, great snacks are available right outside the campus and franky, boy!.. that\'s a hot favourite among the students. ',pos
'Moderate faculty with a dominance of junior professors, which is the case in most new colleges. Only the HoD’s are well learned, knowledgeable and experienced. Good part about faculty is that they are all friendly & co-operative. ',pos
'The college is newly established and the infrastructure is still under construction. However, the required equipment are available and practicals are not hampered. Library also well-stocked with required books. The campus is huge but lacks proper playground. ',pos
'This is one of the few things students say Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College (SAKEC) is good at. The math faculty is brilliant. The other faculties too are decent (at least in the first year, after that it doesn\'t really matter because you get immune to such things). The electronics faculty is quite good throughout. The Computers faculty is average; so is the IT department. Students say some teachers can make life pretty difficult, but that’s always there. ',pos
'The college is awesome. It is good for studies with good interior and a decent level of discipline ',pos
'HOD’s are highly qualified and have a thorough knowledge of the subjects. The major cause of worry are the temporary staff, who are fresher and trying their hand at teaching. Most of the lecturers are just BE pass-outs and are doing their masters now. Internal marks depend upon your conduct and your rapport with the teachers. Most of the faculties teach in Hindi, Marathi and English. So vernacular medium students have no complains. ',pos
'In Shivajirao Jonndhale College of engineering, attendance is not that big an issue. But it depends solely upon Principal’s & HOD’s mood. Temporary teachers are not that strict about attendance. If you appear in defaulter list, they ask for a letter from your Parents. In extreme cases parent are called to the college to meet HOD. ',pos
'attendance doesn\'t matter at all, just complete your assignments on time and you\'re done! ',pos
'SIES has good faculty. Students understand what they are taught.Very helpful as well (except some teachers). The faculty in a short span has raised the academic level of the college to be a leader among the similar institutions in Navi Mumbai and is about to catch up with the most leading engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai. ',pos
'canteen is maintained very well with an extra floor for more convince. ',pos
'A mix of crowd (majority is South Indian, but doesn’t matter).You’ll find both kinds of people here fun-loving and books-crazy. A very energetic crowd makes the college environment vibrant and active. ',pos
'L&T InfoTech, Mumbai, Hexaware Technologies Mumbai, Infosys Technologies, Accenture, NSE IT, Wipro Technologies, Bangalore, Tech Mahindra Ltd., Mahindra British Telecom, Pune and many more.Minimum Salary offered 1,20,000 p.a.Maximum Salary offered 3,50,000 p.a.Average Salary offered 2,25,000 p.a. ',pos
'Overall, a decent college with the only disadvantage for Mumbaikars being its location. A good one though for those who stay close from there or those who don\'t mind traveling. ',pos
'Since SIES Graduate School of Technology/SIES College of Engineering has recently opened(2002), the infrastructure is decent. Unlike many other engineering colleges, labs are excellent. The campus is also very clean and well maintained. ',pos
'superb location and respectable office staff ',pos
'SIES has a good canteen. Enough room and nice food. The South Indian is (obviously) really good, but even the \'lunch\' is quite tasty.The downside of the canteen is that it’s common for all the other coursers like MBA, BSc, Commerce, 11th and 12th. ',pos
'Many teachers are well-qualified and experienced at Smt. Indira Gandhi College of Engineering (SIGCE). They usually don’t fail students in oral examinations and internal assessment and thus they continue to remain in the good books of the students. Overall, faculty is average. ',pos
'attendence is the best part of this college ',pos
'The canteen of Smt. Indira Gandhi College of Engineering (SIGCE) is not spacious and it becomes suffocating during breaks. But apart from that, it is hygienic and the food is cheap and edible. ',pos
'they missed 1 good hangout place - there is a river which flows behiand the college. It is very clean and students can come here to have fun picnic-style ! ',pos
'crowd is too good! ',pos
'festivals are as rocking as it can get! ',pos
'SFIMAR, as fondly called by the students, is a three storey white colour building. Even though the campus is small, it’s excellently maintained; thanks to the beautiful green garden. The classrooms are air conditioned with single seater bench. Projectors are available for every class. Wifi connectivity is good and students rarely complain about anything related to infrastructure. Library is filled with books of marketing, finance, magazines and newspapers. All in all, the infrastructure is pretty satisfactory. ',pos
'Canteen is just about okay and serves average quality food. Prices are economical and non veg food item is a hot favourite among students. ',pos
'There are innumerable places for hangouts near the college. Fizzy, the most visited place by youngsters, serves some fruit drinks, sodas and Tibbs Frankie. Aashirwad, Dominos, Banjara, Kosmic Sea Lounge, Silver Coin, etc are the various food parlours, lounge and restaurants near to the college. McDonalds, Temptations and Naturals are the good past time and elegant hangouts. ',pos
'Well, the crowd at this college is pretty awesome. The legacy of St. Francis is followed from the school to undergrad and post grad. They say, ‘At Francis, once you make friends, they become like a small family’. Students are from other parts of the country are hardly seen in this college. Sex ratio is pretty much equal. Campus life isn’t stressful. Students are overloaded with assignments but they manage to enjoy life equally. ',pos
'Good for academics, second to only Bharati Vidyapeeth amongst pharmacy colleges in Navi Mumbai, NCRD Sterling Institute of Management has only big drawback - high fees coupled with heavy fines. ',pos
'NCRD Sterling Institute of Pharmacy (SIP) promises to place anyone who wants to take up a job and the college does its best to keep its word.

'The canteen at Terna Engineering College is very spacious with unhygienic yet edible food. A lot items on the menu, from Chinese to juices and milkshakes, everything is economical and fairly priced. There is this kind of royal (not so much) sofa arrangement which can seat an entire group and is preferred over the other table arrangements. The chocolate milk being the most expensive at Rs.20. Nice. ',pos
'The teaching staff at TSEC is good and well-qualified. They have proper knowledge about the subject. Teaching abilities, however, vary from professor to professor and depending on your luck, you may get excellent or average teachers. Lectures are communicated in English. All the teachers are extremely friendly and sharing an amazing rapoort witht the students. ',pos

'No, there are all kind of students...ranging from average, geeky to scholars.No, there is no cast discrimination! you will be comfortable with your classmates in college ',pos
'The annual intra collegiate event of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College (TSEC) is called Avalanche and is usually held in October.

',pos
'Great college and package... seniors are really cool and helpful. All engaged in some or the other society. Though there is a password for WiFi which you\'ll have to obtain.. 6th and 8th floor provides free wifi ;) good teachers. Some do take lectures in AC seminar halls... great college. 2nd preference for chemical first being UDCT ',pos

Hundreds of share rickshaws from the station drop you to the college. Most students prefer share rickshaws while some don\'t mind to walk upto the college.Accessibility to the college has never been an issue. ',pos
'Food is good and edible. So if you forget your dabba at home, sometimes it\'s a delight. Comparatively, a very big area and so doesn’t cause much suffocation, even during the peak hours of lunch time. ',pos
'Average faculty. Teachers take the pains to teach and students understand what they are taught as well. The teachers are very helpful. Somehow, the EXTC department students aren\'t very fond of the teachers and their teaching. They\'ve loads to complain about them. Fortunately, Computers and IT department students have lauding words for their professors. ',pos
'Canteen is best place to hang out with presence of eye popping chicks sweetie. ',pos
'Pizza Hut, CCD, Colassa (Hukkah Joint/Chinese Food), Monarch Restaurant, Jumbo King Vada Pav are all close to Thakur College of Engineering & Technology (TCET). Dominos, Nirvana and some excellent hangouts in Kandivali Lokhandwala are also very famous. Thakur Cinema and Kulraj Broadway is the place where you\'ll find most of the college. ',pos
'A mix breed of crowd - fun loving as well as nerds - students blend well though. Entertaining, decent and fun-to-have life. Majority are, however, not much interested in studies though the scene is changing since a few years. Being located in the western suburbs, students from locations like Navi Mumbai and Central/Harbour Mumbai aren\'t particularly keen about joining Thakur College is big numbers. ',pos
'Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Accenture and Syntel are the major recruiters at Thakur College of Engineering. Average salary must be around Rs. 2.5 lac/year. Placement records over the last few years have been close to 100\%. ',pos
'Location and infrastructure adds charm to Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET). The faculty is good yet the students here aren’t so keen on studying. So, a mixed reaction for this college. ',pos
'Thakur College of Engineering and Technology (TCET) has excellent Infrastructure. One of the best in town. Huge campus. You can see the pictures of the college and read its own description about its infrastructure on its official website. And you might happen to spot celebrities if you stay after the college timings, as a lot of television ad film shootings take place in the campus, so you can now imagine how good the location and the infrastructure would be. ',pos
'college has a really good infra ',pos
'attendance is compulsory 75\% but you can get away with less than that.Just be nice to the profs and respect them in class, you wont have any problems as such. ',pos
'Excellent canteen. Very roomy but gets completely occupied as it is shared by students of all the faculties. Great food nevertheless. Students especially love the seating arrangement that has been done very thoughtfully and typical lounge style chairs have been provided. ',pos
'BMS and BMM faculty is really good with professors having good knowledge about their subjects. The faculty for B.COM is just about average with a few professors who have a mere 2-3 years of experience. Major communication is in English but a majority of teachers are found speaking in Hindi (the feel of Minority Quota) while a few use broken English. ',pos
'Apart from the crowd, the college campus, hangouts, and the canteen should drive the students to go for Thakur. This will be an ideal choice for any suburban student having an average (or above average) marks. Arguably Thakur is one of the best college on the Virar-Goregaon belt of the Western suburbs. ',pos
'This parameter is something to look for. The College building is pretty tall and the campus is extremely HUGE as almost all the courses-Science, Commerce, Arts, Diploma, Engineering, and MBA are offered. BSc-IT, BMS and Engineering students have an upper edge as they get air conditioned classrooms. The library is well equipped and books of all possible courses are easily available. There is Wi-fi connectivity in the college, unfortunately commerce students aren’t allowed to use it. ',pos
'Apart from the local hangouts inside and outside the college, the canteen is something to watch out for. There is one common canteen for all the students, so anytime you drop in; you find some one or the other. Good, delicious and hygienic food at a nominal price with a huge space gives a Thumbs Up to the Thakur Canteen! ',pos
'Within the campus there is Nescafe tea stall and a local sandwich guy, the two of which are the hot favourites of any Thakur student. CCD, Pizza Hut, Dominos and a few other expensive food parlours are one of the greatest hangouts nearby the college. For those who don’t want to spend a lot, there are few tapris outside the college. Also, one can cross the highway and have Tibbs Frankie in Thakur Complex. Movie lovers can enjoy the screening in multiplexes like Fame, Cinemax and Kulraj Broadway. ',pos
'Since there is Hindi Speaking Minority quota, undoubtedly you meet a lot of ‘brothers’ and UP-ites. Most the students are from nearby suburbs and the college gets a good amount of students from Mira Road every year. One of the girls quoted, ‘The BMM and BMS crowd is still tolerable but the Science and Commerce students are just ewwww. In short, we don’t have a happening crowd’. You can expect to meet a few students who are deeply into studies but still most of the crowd believes in extra curricular activities. ',pos
'Tarangan, the festival of Thakur College, is held in December. Another festival which is bigger and better than the previous one is Trishna which is held in January. ',pos
'Thakur College ensures conducting On-Campus Placements for BSc IT and BMS students. Companies like Zenta Technologies, IBM, Wipro India Ltd., ICICI Prudential, MBT, Infosys, Accenture, Mastek, Cognizant and Direct I have visited the college till date. ',pos
'The lecturers are quite experienced and have thorough knowledge related to their subject. There a few visiting faculties over the weekend and most of the students literally wait for those lectures. Few professors have a mere 3-4 years of industrial experience but majority of them have an amazing background. ',pos
'The infrastructure of TIMSR is excellent. A/C classrooms with projectors, single seater benches and the recreational centre make it even better. There is a 600 seater auditorium. The library is vast and has all the possible books pertaining to Finance, HR and Marketing. There is Wi-fi in the campus which makes exchanging emails and research work simpler. ',pos
'Almost all the students participate in all the possible events held in Thakur College. The crowd is pretty decent and give equal importance to studies and extra curricular activities. As the campus encompasses many other degree colleges of Thakur, the campus life is pretty awesome. MBA students can hardly bunk their lecturers, but whenever they do, they’re found in the recreational centres, Nescafe within the campus and the pan waala for obvious reasons. ',pos
'Majority of the teachers are freshers with only few Phd’s completing the teaching staff. Almost all the teachers communicate in Hindi. The good part for the students is that they are extremely co-operative. ',pos
'Travelling is the big problem here as there are only trains after 1 hr & that too is rushed. There is no local trains to boisar to add to the problems & there is no hostel facilities near to college the faculty is bad ',pos
'Various restaurants in Matunga and among favourites are Mani’s Idli, Sherry’s Rolls and Frankies (best and the cheapest), Garnish, Classic, Relax, etc. There’s Only Parathas and Madras Café for those who eat only in \'elite\' restaurants. CCD is also close by. ',pos
'Also crowd is much better than the other MU colleges. (maybe leaving aside DJ.Sanghvi)It has the best extra-curricular activites and its a dream college for the robotics and automation people. ',pos
'50\% crowd is awsome....great miands ',pos
'Festivals: Rocking! ',pos
'The best part about VJTI is the awesome fests it holds every year and the over-ENTHUsiastic crowd. These are the best held fests for enginneering colleges in Mumbai. ',pos

'VJTI is a really good collegeage. I don\'t think teaching is a problem there. its true its not as it was few years ago, fir bhi you can easily survive 4 years here. and hostels are not that bad, you will really enjoy hostel life there ',pos
'Huge campus. Infra Old but has a heritage touch ',pos
'The campus of VJTI is huge, one might even get lost initially. Lots of open space, a cricket and a football field, tennis courts and basketball court are available for recreational activities. However the buildings being old, the classrooms and the labs are not places you’ll enjoy being in. “You’ll get baked to death in the heat during the summers”, says a second year Mechanical student. Many instruments in labs are old which often fail to function properly. You can access internet from computer labs whenever you wish. Wi-Fi connectivity has been promised but not been installed yet. ',pos
'Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, popular as VJTI, is an esteemed autonomous government engineering institute located in central Mumbai. It is just a 5 minute drive or 12-15 minute walk from Dadar (W. Rly & C. Rly.), Matunga (C. Rly.), Wadala (Harbour Rly.) and King’s Circle (Harbour Rly.) stations. Number of BEST buses plying from all parts of Mumbai is also a good option to reach the college. ',pos
'Canteen: Normal. Edible food. Not an issue! ',pos
'The canteen has changed!! Its awesome now!! ',pos
'Some of the experienced teaching faculty that Vidyalankar Institute of Technology (VIT) had before. have left the college. The other old and senior teaching faculties are extremely good but there are a few freshers (passed out students), who are not up to the mark. Professors are co-operative. Because of the association with Vidyalankar classes the faculty is experienced in teaching and industry demands. Notes of Vidyalankar coaching classes are distributed to all students. ',pos
'you get good quality food and are cheap rates in the canteen. ',pos
'don\'t worry about hangout places,because you won\'t need any.. Cafeteria is best for tp with friends (Or anywhere within building,afterall its a MALL).New thing started last semester \'Coffee Day\' ',pos
'I oppose that crowd is average..college has good crowd..many of students cme from good location like Dadar,Bandra,Colaba...and many more..SO vit is changing.. ',pos
'Vidyalankar Institute of Technology (VIT) celebrates an inter-collegiate technical festival, FERVOR, an intra-collegiate cultural festival, VERVE, and an inter-collegiate sports festival are held in the college campus around February/March. The highlight of the sports festival is the S6 (Six a side - Six overs) cricket tournament in which more than 15 colleges participate. It also includes intra-collegiate competitions in volleyball, box-cricket, throwball, carrom, chess etc. ',pos
'Placements at Vidyalankar are quite decent, mainly because of the contacts the college administration has within the industry. Infosys and Patni pick the maximum students. Infosys has selected Vidyalankar as a partner for its Campus-Connect Program, wherein they train Pre-final year Vidyalankar students to make them industry ready.Average salaries range around Rs.3 lac p.a. to Rs. 3.5 lac p.a. for BTech students. ',pos
'Campus selection/placements are great every year. ',pos
'college is very great and its teaching staff is very helpfulOne of the best teachers were first the teachers of this college like Dubey Sir of Mechanics & Engineering. drwinPowar Sir of BEEVelenker Sir of CPAnkur Sir of EDCPhatak Sir of Mathsand a very supporting and students caring Principal....Seema Shah Mam ',pos
'the infrastructure is awesome .............only the bad thing is that it is surrouanded by slums but inside the campus its very good environment ... ',pos
'Attendance at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology (VIT) is not quite an issue. No extra assignments or any such action is taken against defaulters. However, some teachers who want to show that they should be given more importance might cause minor glitches by reducing the term work marks of defaulters. So, it would be wise to be cautious of such teachers. Most of the teaching & non-teaching staff are extremely friendly & helpful but there are a few exceptions, you need to attend those certain lectures. So, it would be wise to be cautious of such teachers. ',pos
'A canteen and a cafe both offer a wide range of food and beverages. Food is edible and moderately cheap. VITs campus has a striking eatery outlet - \'snack in d box\'. Food is reasonable in the canteen & in the café, starting from Rs. 20 to a maximum of Rs. 60, but \'snack in d box\' is comparatively costlier. ',pos
'The faculty are very experience and knowledgeable, so learning from them is a pleasure. Industry experts are invited to take lectures on various topics. The management of the college is very aggressive about faculties that do not perform, or can’t teach well, and are changed. The students handle a lot of things of the college, and with that encourage new and prompt ideas. Moreover, the director of the college was the ex-director of NMIMS, and he is pretty much popular among the students. Other faculty members also have been teachers at some of the prestigious Management institutes around. The faculties that live on-campus are freely approachable even after college hours, in case of academic doubts. The faculty gives students all the freedom to plan their sessions, and it works on a continuous feedback system. The faculty and the management always want to get better. But one thing very clear with the students & the faculty is that Discipline is very important. ',pos
'When it comes to placements, the students very confidently boast about the 100\% placements the college achieves, year-on-year. Companies which are into varied businesses come to recruit students. The list includes, Naukri.com, L&T Infotech in the IT Sector, Future Group: hires students for their operations wing, United Breweries, banks like Kotak Mahindra, RBI, also visit the campus. So it’s a very healthy scene here with regards to placements. The most important part now: the packages, well, the average salary is around 4-5Lakh Rupees per annum, and the highest a student offered here was Rs.9 Lakh a year. ',pos
'The college has achieved a lot in leaps and bounce. Upthate in review needed. ',pos
'The faculty at Watumull is a mixture. Some are good and experienced while there are a few who are ordinary too. The computers faculty is nice, but it is a bit strict. The biomedical faculty is like a school faculty. The faculty of the instrumentation branch is Ok. One faculty worth mentioning is of the EXTC branch. The EXTC has very good professors. ',pos
'Worli Seaface, Mafco, Atria mall and various other restaurants around. “Mela” serves good food but is a bit expensive. Spices and Flavours is another good option. Phoenix mills is a fantastic option, but it is a little far. There is great roll/frankly point right outside the main gate, which is very famous, you might want to try that out too. ',pos
'The crowd rocks. It is quite nice. Everyone is down to earth and quite co-operative and fun-loving. Well, there are a few exceptions, but those are obviously there everywhere. If you are lucky enough you will get good company. There are some groups who come from the same junior college, so getting into those could be difficult. Overall, you will have four pretty pleasant years. Also, the college has plenty of special days every now and then. Traditional, rose, chocolate, stripes, and many more. Life is enjoyable. ',pos
'instrumentation crowd is awesome...lif wid them is enjoyable...otherwise some crowd of computer and bio are like school crowd...cryin babies...however ther are exceptions....you mit find some crowd kanjus also and mannerless....so its really hard to get a good company here. ',pos
'There is 90\% placement this year, Companies like Patni, Infosys, JP morgan, Accenture, CapeGemini, Sudherland, Blue star(biomedical core), Sanrad international(biomedical), Tech Mahiandra,GE IT, LandT, LandT IES, Cactus communication, CMC etc have recruited students from watumull this year, and it seems progressing in coming future.and as of every year, this year also watumull has university rankers from biomedical department. ',pos
'very good atmospheregood crowd ',pos
'along with that the teaching staff is quite experienced and then passing rate is also good compared to others...It has been a very satisfying experience ',pos
'Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology functions from a single eight-storey building, which underwent renovation sometime back and plans are afoot to add another two floors to the building for additional laboratories and other facilities. The college has no open grounds. However, it does have other sporting facilities for playing table tennis, football, cricket, chess and carrom. ',pos
'The location of this college also rocks. ',pos
'The canteen at Watumull is very nice. The food is very tasty and cheap too. The canteen is not very spacious, so as to accommodate all the students during the lunch break, but students somehow manage. The canteen is a good place for people who like to dig into chinese food.A special mention : Triple schezwan rice made by Shiva!! ',pos
'There are many Christians because of the Christian quota at Xavier Engineering College. Overall the crowd is good and you won’t realize where time went by. Four years of engineering can be easily dealt with. ',pos
'The cultural festival of Xavier Institute of Engineering is “Spandan” and the technical festival is “Transmission”. They are usually held in February in alternate years. So, effectively only one festival to have fun every year. SIGH! ',pos
'60\% of the students get placed. Tech Mahindra takes maximum students. Patni, Infosys, Accenture and Quinox are the other major companies. The placements and salaries offered are just about average. It is said that Panasonic recruited a student from EXTC and offered 12 lakh p.a.. Hope it\'s true. ',pos
'Placement is OK compared to quality of teaching ',pos
'few horrible teachers ',pos
'The canteen is small and there is too less variety of food to offer. XAVIER’s MANAGEMENT, if you ever happen to read this, please do something about it. The prices are economical though. ',pos
'Xavier\'s Institute of Management & Research (XIMR) is part of renowned St. Xavier\'s College campus situated between Metro Big Cinemas and the BMC building near CST. It\'s about 7 minutes walking distance from the Central and Harbour Railway Terminus and is also pretty much accessible by numerous buses plying all across the city. ',pos
'Faculty is great for the marketing department. Other departments too have respectable faculty – certainly not bad, but not fantastic either. Visiting faculties that teach some specific subjects and the heads of various departments are awesome. ',pos
'Students come from various parts of Mumbai but those from Navi Mumbai are certainly in more numbers. The overall crowd and campus environment appears a little gloomy with more concentration on academic life than on co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. ',pos
